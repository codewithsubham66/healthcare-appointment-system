Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements In this initial phase, we laid the foundation for the project.

Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling System Problem Statement:- Healthcare providers often face challenges in managing patient appointments effectively.

Manual scheduling leads to double-bookings, long wait times, and inefficient use of doctor's availability.

Limited patient engagement results in missed appointments and poor communication.

Lack of transparency makes it difficult for patients to track, reschedule, or cancel appointments.

Administrative overhead consumes staff time that could be focused on patient care.

This project aims to build a centralized Appointment Scheduling System on Salesforce to streamline booking, enhance patient experience, and provide real-time insights and updates to healthcare providers.

Phase 2: Salesforce Org Setup & Configuration In this phase, we performed the initial technical setup inside a Salesforce Developer org.

App Creation: We created a new Lightning App named "Healthcare Appointment App" to serve as the main workspace for users.

Custom Object: We built a custom objects named 'Patients','Doctors','Appointments' to store the info of patients and their appointments with doctors.

Custom Fields: We added several custom fields  to the objects to store the information of Patients,Doctors & Appointments in details like Name,contact Number,Email Address,disease,Appointment date/time etc etc.

Tabs & Navigation: We created custom tabs to make it accessible and configured the app's main navigation bar.

Documentation: We took screenshots of all key setup steps and uploaded them to the repository for documentation purpose of phase 2 configuration and setup.

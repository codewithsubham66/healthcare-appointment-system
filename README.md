Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling System
Problem Statement:-
Healthcare providers often face challenges in managing patient appointments effectively.

Manual scheduling leads to double-bookings, long wait times, and inefficient use of doctor's availability.

Limited patient engagement results in missed appointments and poor communication.

Lack of transparency makes it difficult for patients to track, reschedule, or cancel appointments.

Administrative overhead consumes staff time that could be focused on patient care.

This project aims to build a centralized Appointment Scheduling System on Salesforce to streamline booking, enhance patient experience, and provide real-time insights and updates to healthcare providers.
